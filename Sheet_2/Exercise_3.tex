\subsection*{Exercise 3}
\textbf{Show that any 2-connected graph contains a cycle.} \\
\linebreak
In order for a graph $G$ to be $k-$connected, it must have at least $k+1$ vertices, i.e. $|V(G)| \geq k+1$. So, $V|G| \geq 3$. \\
\linebreak
As $G$ is connected with $|V(G)| \geq 3$ vertices, $\exists$ at least one vertex $v$ s.t. $d(v) \geq 2$. Let the neighbourhood $N_G(v)$ contain vertices $u$ and $w$. \\
\linebreak 
As $G$ is connected, $\exists$ a path $uPw = \{uv, vw\}$. We also know that as $G$ is 2-connected, we can remove either $uv$ or $vw$ without disconnecting the graph. \\
\linebreak 
So, $\exists$ some path $uP'w$ that does not contain $uv$ or $vw$. \\
\linebreak 
As $uPw$ and $uP'w$ are disjoint, we know $\exists$ a path $C = uPw \cup wP'u$, which is in fact a cycle. Therefore, any 2-connected graph must contain a cycle.
