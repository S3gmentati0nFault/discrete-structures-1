\boldmath\textbf{Is there a function $f: \nat \rightarrow \nat$ such that every $f(k)$-edge-connected graph is $k$-connected? Justify your answer.\\

\unboldmath
If we have a graph $G$ that is $f(k)$-edge connected, there is no function that guarantees that the resulting graph is $k$-connected for any $G$. This is the case in graphs that have cut vertices (a cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of components of the graph). \\
\linebreak 
In the case of a graph with 1 or more cut vertices, the edge connectivity can be arbitrarily high, but the graph remains 1-connected. Take, for example a graph consisting of two complete graphs $K^1_n$ and $K^2_{n'}$ with a single vertex in common (this is then the cut vertex). See, for example, \ref{fig:wrong}, here $K^1_4 = \{v1, v5, v6, v7\}$ and $K^2_4 = \{v2, v3, v4, v5\}$. The two graphs share vertex $v5$. \\
\linebreak
This means that even for some graph with a very high edge-connectivity, and so a high $f(k)$ value, $k$ is still equal to 1. We cannot define a function such that the $k = 1$ and $f(k)$ is some value irrespective of the vertex connectivity. In conclusion, we cannot define a function $f: \nat \rightarrow \nat$ such that every $f(k)$-edge-connected graph is $k$-connected. \qed
