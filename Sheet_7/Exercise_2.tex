\subsection*{Exercise 2}
\boldmath\textbf{Show that a graph $G$ contains a matching which covers at least $2k$ vertices if and only if $q(G - S) \leq |S| + |V(G)| - 2k$ for all sets $S \subseteq V(G)$\\

Proof $(\implies)$} \unboldmath If $G$ contains a matching which covers at least $2k$ vertices then $q(G - S) \leq |S| + |V(G)| - 2k$ for all sets $S \subseteq V(G)$\\ 
\linebreak
Let's suppose by contradiction that the thesis doesn't hold. That means that $\exists S \subseteq V(G)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    q(G - S) > |S| + |V(G)| - 2k
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q(G - S)$ is the number of odd-components (connected component with an odd number of vertices)
    \item $|V(G)| - 2k$ is the number of unmatched vertices in $G$
\end{itemize}
Let's suppose our matching maximal.\\
\linebreak
We know that to any unmatched vertex corresponds an odd-component, thus:
\begin{equation*}
    q(G) = |V(G)| - 2k
\end{equation*}
By hypothesis there is a set of vertices $S$ that we can remove from $|V(G)|$ without breaking the matching, that implies that we will still be covering at least $2k$ vertices.\\
The only way we can remove vertices from $G$ without removing vertices from the matching is by removing unmatched vertices. Whenever we remove an unmatched vertex the odd-component becomes even, thus:
\begin{equation*}
    q(G - S) \leq (|V(G)| - 2k) - |S|
\end{equation*}
If that weren't true we would be having more odd-components after removing vertices from $V(G)$, but that can only happen if we are removing vertices from even components because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The matching is supposed maximal.
    \item Every even-component has a perfect matching, then all of the vertices are matched.
\end{itemize}
But
\begin{equation*}
    q(G - S) \leq (|V(G)| - 2k) - |S| \leq (|V(G)| - 2k) + |S|
\end{equation*}
Thus
\begin{equation*}
    q(G - S) \leq (|V(G)| - 2k) + |S|
\end{equation*}
And we reached an absurd, because we supposed the opposite thus if a graph $G$ contains a $2k$-matching the number of odd components in $G - S$ is $|S| + |V(G)|$. \qed\\

\textbf{Proof} $(\impliedby)$ \unboldmath If $q(G - S) \leq |S| + |V(G)| - 2k$ for all sets $S \subseteq V(G)$ then $G$ contains a matching which covers at least $2k$ vertices. \\
\linebreak
The proof for this section is almost certaintly relying on Gallai-Edmonds decomposition, but we couldn't find a way to prove that formally.
The idea would be the following, supposing that point 1, 2, 3 and 3' hold for Gallai-Edmonds decomposition, then we can apply the \textit{Lemma 2.8} that states that if the above condition holds then $G$ has a matching which covers all but at most
\begin{equation*}
    q(G - S) - |S|
\end{equation*}
vertices, but our hypothesis tells us that $q(G - S) \leq (|V(G)| - 2k) + |S|$, thus we have a matching that covers at most
\begin{equation}
    (|V(G)| - 2k) + |S| - |S| = |V(G)| - 2k
\end{equation}
Which is exactly what we want to prove. \qed
