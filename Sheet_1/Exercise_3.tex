\textbf{Show that any graph $G$ contains a subgraph of minimun degree at least $\frac{d(G)}{2}$\\\linebreak 
Proof\\}
\unboldmath
For any graph $G$ we can always find a subgraph $H$ such that $\delta(H) \geq \frac{d(G)}{2}$. Infact by \textit{Proposition 1.5} we can grant that any graph $G$ with at least one edge has a subgraph $H$ with:
\begin{equation*}
    \delta(H) > \varepsilon(H) \geq \varepsilon(G)
\end{equation*}
In case $G$ contains less than one edge then we just have to take the whole $G$ to make the statement true.\qed
