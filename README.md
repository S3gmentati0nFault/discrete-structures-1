I'm changing the pourpose of this repository, I want to try and provide the best possible content
for the course thus all of the solutions here proposed will be revised and corrected so that they
can (maybe) serve a pourpose and especially because this way my ADHD will be at peace.
<br>
In the following can be found the roadmap of the various changes that I want to provide for the
content.

<h2>Work in progess: </h2>

- [x] Exercise 1 sheet 1
- [ ] Exercise 2 sheet 1

- [ ] Exercise 4 (B and C) sheet 1
- [ ] Exercise 4 sheet 2
- [ ] Exercise 3 sheet 3
- [ ] Exercise 4 sheet 3
- [ ] Exercise 5 sheet 3
- [ ] Exercise 1 sheet 4
- [ ] Exercise 3 sheet 4
- [ ] Exercise 4 sheet 4

- [ ] exercise 4A sheet 5
- [ ] Exercise 1 sheet 6
- [ ] Exercise 2 sheet 6
- [ ] Exercise 3C sheet 6
- [ ] Exercise 4 sheet 6

In general it would be also nice if we were able, in the production of our solutions, to stick to
some kind of code etiquette, but we still have to choose what to do with it, most of the Latex code
here contained doesn't respect best practices (e.g. don't use the "\\\\" command outside of math-mode
unless strictly necessary), but we like it so far.

Credits for part of this work go to Ella Nooman, who is in group with me and is helping me solve the exercises.
