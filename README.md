These are my solutions to the exercise sheets proposed for the course of Discrete Structures at Heidelberg University, held by Professor Bertille, during the winter semester 2023/2024.
<br>
Since the course is over and I didn't go through all of the exercises (and I am surely not going through others) and I am going to leave the repository in the current state, most of the exercise sheets have been solved but not corrected in any way. Enjoy the course if you are attempting it.

In general it would be also nice if we were able, in the production of our solutions, to stick to
some kind of code etiquette, but we still have to choose what to do with it, most of the Latex code
here contained doesn't respect best practices (e.g. don't use the "\\\\" command outside of math-mode
unless strictly necessary), but we like it so far.

Credits for part of this work go to Ella Nooman, who is in group with me and is helping me solve the exercises.
