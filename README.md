This repository contains all of the exercises that have been proposed during the course of Discrete Structures 1 (2023) hosted at Heidelberg university. All of the proposed solutions have been uploaded and never corrected, unless the solution was completely wrong.
<br>
Anyone using this repository should consider it just as a reference to understand the amount of work involved in handling the course assignements.
<br>
Credits for part of this work go to Ella Nooman, who is in group with me and is helping me solve the exercises.
