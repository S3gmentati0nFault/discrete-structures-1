\textbf{Let $G$ be a graph on $n \geq 3$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}$. Show that $G$ is
$2$-connected.}

\textbf{Proof}\\
We want to prove the above by contradiction, let's suppose that $\delta(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}$ does
not imply is $2$-connectivity.\\
$2$-connectivity would imply the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph has at least three nodes (which is true by hypothesis).
    \item $G \setminus \{v\}$, where $v$ is a generic vertex inside the graph, is still connected.
\end{itemize}
Since the graph is not $2$-connected removing a vertex actually compromises connectivity, thus
whenever we remove a vertex from $V(G)$ we get two different components that we'll call $A$ and
$B$.\\
\linebreak
Both components must have $\delta(X) = \floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}}$, where $X$ is the generic component.
That means that in both components there has to be a vertex $v$ such that its degree $d_X(v) =
\floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}}$.
Let's suppose that the above statement was not true and, without loss of generality, let's suppose
that $A$ has $\delta(A) > \floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}}$. Then $\delta(B) < \floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}} <
\frac{n}{2}$ because if $\delta(B) \geq \floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}}$ as well it would mean that there
would be a vertex $u$ in $B$ connected to at least as many vertices as $v$ in $A$ and that would be
against the hypothesis because $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$. Thus the graph would still be connected\\
\linebreak
To conclude, since both $A$ and $B$ have a vertex ($v \in V(A) \land u \in V(B)$) that should be connected to at least
$\floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}}$ other vertices, and $N(v) \cap N(u) = \emptyset$ then we can say that
\begin{equation}
    |N(v)| + |N(u)| = n(G)
\end{equation}
thus
\begin{equation*}
    \floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}} + \floor{\frac{n - 1}{2}} + 2\footnote{The $+2$ comes from the fact that
    the neighbourhood does not account for the node itself} = n + 1
\end{equation*}
And that is a contradiction because the graph contains $n$ vertices.\\
This proves that if a graph has at least three vertices and $\delta(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}$, then it
must be $2$-connected. \hspace{10mm} $\square$
